A set of problems have been identified with estimated resources required to address them:
---
{{$input}}
---
Utilizing the identified set of problems with their respective resource requirements, brainstorm innovative solutions. Organize your ideas into two categories based on resource intensity. Present these ideas in a markdown table with two columns: 'Lower-hanging fruit' for solutions requiring 'MEDIUM' or 'LOW' resources, and 'Higher-hanging fruit' for those needing 'HIGH' resources. Ensure each column contains ten ideas, focusing on products, programs, or features suitable for each resource category. Use markdown formatting with left-justified columns to enhance clarity and readability.

thi is the step by step process
Brainstorming Sessions: Encouraging open and unrestricted thinking to generate a large quantity of ideas. The focus is on quantity over quality, to foster creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.

Mind Mapping: Creating visual diagrams that show the relationship between different ideas. This can help in discovering unexpected connections and combinations.

SCAMPER Technique: Applying SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to explore different ways of transforming existing solutions or creating new ones.

Sketching and Prototyping: Creating quick and rough sketches or models of ideas. This helps in making abstract ideas more concrete and easier to evaluate.

Role Playing: Acting out scenarios to explore ideas and solutions from different perspectives.

Idea Affinity Diagrams: Organizing ideas into clusters based on their similarities or themes. This helps in synthesizing the brainstorming output into coherent groups.

Voting and Prioritization: Using methods like dot voting to prioritize ideas based on their feasibility, potential impact, and alignment with user needs and business goals.

The format should read:
In a markdown table there are two columns labeled "Lower-hanging fruit" and "Higher-hanging fruit". Each of the columns are left justified using markdown formatting ":---" explicitly.
The first column has ten ideas for products, programs, or features that should be implemented for cases where any resource requirements are MEDIUM or LOW.
The second column has ten ideas for products, programs, or features that should be implemented for cases where any resource requirements are HIGH.
| Lower-hanging fruit | Higher-hanging fruit |
|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| Idea 1 for medium/low resources | Idea 1 for high resources |
| Idea 2 for medium/low resources | Idea 2 for high resources |
| ... (continue for 10 ideas each) | ... (continue for 10 ideas each) |
